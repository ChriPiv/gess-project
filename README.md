## General Introduction

The importance of understanding the dynamics in a financial market and the parameters that determine investor behaviour is manifested in the various policy efforts that seek to maintain integrity in the financial system. 

For instance, in order to secure market confidence, regulate foreign participation and prevent collusion, policy makers have become increasingly interested in identifying dominant trading strategies and the social effects that level the playing field. The market composition plays a significant role in the predictive analysis as it is likely to exacerbate inherent financial dynamics. Examples are the speculative bubbles experienced in 2000 and 2007 as observed by Kaizoji et al [2].

One of the earliest works similar to this project is [4], which uses an agent-based economic model. Further related works that use the same model have mostly investigated emerging market characteristics (formation of demand/supply or characteristic price formation). Since the agent-based model has proven its usefulness in modelling market characteristics we feel comfortable to adopt and expand the proposed model in order to study how emergent market characteristics propagate back to the agent as in how they adapt their strategies.


## The Model

We use an agent-based model losely based on [1] to simulate a financial market. At every timestep each agent makes a buy/sell order which consists of an amount of assets to be traded and a limit price at which those assets are to be traded.

This amount is computed in the following way: The agent considers how many assets it wants to own next timestep. This value is drawn from a normal distribution with mean <i>mu<sub>S</sub></i> and standard deviation <i>sigma<sub>S</sub></i>:<br/>
<i>mu<sub>S</sub></i> = currentAmountOfAssets * (1 + (marketPrice - meanMarketPriceOverNTimesteps) * agentConservativeness + priceMomentum * agentInfluencability)<br/>
<i>sigma<sub>S</sub></i> = agentNoisiness<br />
We see that <i>mu<sub>S</sub></i> starts out to be around the current amount of assets of the agent. There are two forces influencing <i>mu<sub>A</sub></i>: If the market price is higher(lower) than the average in recent history, then the agent is more likely to sell(buy). If a lot of people are buying(selling) and thus the market price momentum is high(low) the agent is more likely to buy(sell). These two forces are weighted by two agent parameters: its conservativeness and its influencability.
A third parameter governs the behaviour of our agent: its noisiness.

Finally the order price is also taken from a normal distribution with mean <i>mu<sub>P</sub></i> and standard deviation <i>sigma<sub>P</sub></i>:<br/>
<i>mu<sub>P</sub></i> = 0.99 * currentAssetPrice if the agent is buying<br/>
<i>mu<sub>P</sub></i> = 1.01 * currentAssetPrice if the agent is selling<br/>
<i>sigma<sub>P</sub></i> = const. * marketVolatility<br/>

After agents place their bids, the model undergoes price formation. As with [1], we would like to find a market clearing price price <i>p\*</i> for which the highest number of bids can be satisfied. Specifically, we would like the total amount of sell bids below the price to be equal to the total amount of buy bids above the price. Given a sorted list of buy and sell orders, this can be performed in linear time by using a two-pointer implementation. We iterate from the lowest-priced sell order and from the highest-priced buy order, matching pairs of orders as we go, until the current buy price is less than the current sell price. In the case that more satisfiable buy orders exist than sell orders (or vice-versa), the successful bids are chosen randomly. All orders are then executed at <i>p\*</i>, the average of the highest matched sell order and lowest matched buy. Then the next timestep starts and the process repeats.

Agents also undergo a learning process. The model is run for a specific number of time steps, then a ranking of the agents is done considering their final owned wealth. Depending on how successfull each agent was in that ranking, it will adapt its parameters: A successfull agent will only slightly change its parameters, while less successfull agents will vary them more strongly. An imitation process is also used as agents vary their parameters following an estimated fitness gradient. Multiple methods of estimating the gradient are analyzed.

As this convergence process could be extremely complex, we will first start out by reducing our agent paramaters to one dimension. We will fix the agent noisiness to be constant for all agents and tie conservativeness and influencability together:<br />
conservativeness = C - influencability, with C being a constant<br />
basically reducing both parameters to one.


## Fundamental Questions

How does the evolution and distribution of strategies in our market look like?<br />
Does the model converge to a stable distribution of strategies?<br />
How does such a stable strategy distribution look like and how does it depend on the inital parameters?<br />
How many dimension can our agent parameter space have such that the strategy distribution still converges?<br />
Can external interventions on the market (e.g. policies) change the strategy distribution?


## Expected Results

We expect agents having
* a very low influencability to be less successful as they do not account for the herding behaviour in the market.
* a very high influencability to be less successful as they misinterpret market price fluctuations as herding in the market.
* a very low conservativeness to be less successful as they miss out on the moment to buy/sell when the price is very low/high.
* a very high conservativeness to be consistently doing ok, but not standing out as they do not cash in on market herding behaviour.
* a low noisiness to be more consistent.
* a high noisiness to be less consistent but having a higher chance to stand out.

Thus we expect to find a confined subspace of the agent parameter space in which most of the strategies will lie in.

## Research Methods

We will run our agent-based simulations and learning steps for long periods of time and analyze the convergens of the strategy distribution.
